my primary responsibility is to ensure the smooth functioning and security of Linux-based systems. 
I handle everything from installing and configuring the operating system to managing servers, applications, and network services.
One of my key tasks is regular system maintenance, including patch management and updates,
to keep the systems secure and optimized. I also monitor system performance using tools like Checkmk and AppDynamics and resolve any bottlenecks or
issues that might arise.
User management is another critical area. I create and manage user accounts, enforce permissions, and ensure adherence to security policies.
Security is a top priorityâ€”I conduct regular audits, implement system hardening practices, and deploy measures like SELinux and firewalls to safeguard against 
vulnerabilities.
In terms of automation, I have extensive experience with tools like Ansible and Puppet, which I use to automate repetitive tasks and maintain consistent 
system configurations. Additionally, I write custom scripts, often using Bash or Python, to streamline processes and improve efficiency.
Backup and recovery are also crucial parts of my role. I ensure reliable backup systems are in place and verify that recovery processes work seamlessly in case of
failures. Furthermore, I document configurations, procedures, and troubleshooting steps meticulously so that the team always has clear guidelines.
Lastly, I stay updated with the latest trends and tools in Linux systems to ensure that my knowledge is current and relevant.
I believe that being proactive in learning and problem-solving is essential to excelling in this role
